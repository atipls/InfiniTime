# My personal fork of InfiniTime

Basically a somewhat stripped down version of InfiniTime, with a lot of watchfaces removed and a Windows 98-styled watchface added.

Heap unification (InfiniTimeOrg/InfiniTime#1709) and Improved heartrate readings (InfiniTimeOrg/InfiniTime#1486) have been merged to this fork.

I plan on revamping the UI for my personal taste, as well as adding features such as raise-to-wake going to sleep when I lower the watch.
